  <h2>Who is Ashley Heafy?</h2>
  <p>
    I’m an all-around creative. I specialize mostly in graphic design and
    branding. I live part-time in Orlando and the rest of the time traveling
    around the world.
  </p>
  <h2>What was your progression like, from being inspired to finding your own artistic voice?</h2>
  <p>
    I went to a fine arts school—The School of the Art Institute of Chicago. I
    really hadn’t honed in on graphic design until I had a painting teacher who
    was like “I really think that everything you do in incredibly graphic.” I was
    really into Robert Rauschenberg so I was making these paintings that were
    designed and organized. My teacher suggested I save myself some distress and
    some starving artist years and really look into graphic design.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once I went that direction, I never looked back.
  </p>
  <h2>Design-wise, what you you want to see more of in the world?</h2>
  <p>
    I just back from Scandinavian countries. It made me realize what their focus
    and attention to design and detail has done for their everyday lives. Their
    environmental design, their airports…
  </p>
  <p>
    It actually has given their countries a sense of identity from a creative
    perspective that I don’t necessarily think that we have in America.
  </p>
  <h2>What is your favorite place to visit abroad?</h2>
  <p>
    My favorite place to visit abroad is definitely Japan. I’ve been about four
    times now. My husband is half-Japanese so he has a cultural connection there.
    I think it’s important for everyone in their life, at some point, if you live
    in a Western country to visit an Eastern country.
  </p>
  <h2>
    Can you pin it down to what the major difference is between Eastern and
    Western culture?
  </h2>
  <p>
    Oh my gosh! People are so nice! Can I say this? I never get cat-called in
    Japan. Never. Because no one would ever do that. No one would ever objectify
    women publicly and loudly.
  </p>
  <h2>Why should we all be feminists?</h2>
  <p>
    I always just quote Ruth Bader Ginsburg. To this day, we do not have
    anything in the Constitution that says men and women are created equal and
    have equal rights. We’ve passed legislation. We’ve made strides. Women can
    vote.
  </p>
  <p>
    But you know, legislation can always be repealed. It can always be edited
    and changed. But the Constitution needs an Amendment for equality. Until that
    day happens, feminism is necessary.
  </p>
  <h2>What are some things you’re excited about in Orlando?</h2>
  <p>
    Orlando has an incredible community for business and creatives.
  </p>
  <h2>What advice do you have for upcoming generations of Orlando Creators?</h2>
  <p>
    Stay in Orlando. Invest in Orlando. Be a part of the community. When I was
    young I felt like I had to leave Orlando in order to live the creative life I
    wanted to live. As an adult looking back on my younger creative self, I don’t
    think that’s true at all.
  </p>
  <p>
    I think that Orlando is an amazing place to work and I think it’s an amazing
    place to be a part of a creative community. If you involve yourself in the
    community and find your place, then you’ll be successful.
