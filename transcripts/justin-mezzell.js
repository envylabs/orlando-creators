  <h2>Who is Justin Mezzell?</h2>
  <p>
    I’m a designer and illustrator residing in Orlando,
    Florida. I currently serve as the creative director at <a
    href="https://www.codeschool.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Code
    School</a>, do my own freelance illustration, and sell goods
    with a friend of mine, <a href="http://rog.ie/"
    target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rogie King</a>, under the moniker <a
    href="https://superteamdeluxe.com/" target="_blank"
    rel="noopener"><i>Super&nbsp;Team&nbsp;Deluxe</i></a>.

  <h2>Why are you in Orlando?</h2>
  <p>
    I love the place that Orlando’s in right now. I think that we
    have a lot of really great communities of people doing creative
    things. I’ve seen creative projects pop up all over the place. And
    if you decide to take ownership now, you just can. It’s not a
    walled garden. If you decide you want to be vocal and you want to
    be a voice here, you can immediately do it and you can own&nbsp;that.
  </p>
  <h2>
    What’s so special to you about visual creative expression?
  </h2>
  <p>
    I think what originally drew me to it was that I could do it
    myself. There weren’t all of these other inputs that I needed in
    order to get started on it. It’s as simple as having software.
  </p>
  <p>
    By the time I found out design was a career, I was already
    thinking I had to go into these other fields. I figured I’d do
    business or do something else that actually makes money. And then
    I was like “wait—people draw things and make things look nice? And
    they get paid to do this? That sounds really&nbsp;interesting!”
  </p>
  <h2>
    What do you think Orlando needs most right now?
  </h2>
  <p>
    I think Orlando needs people that are willing to start a
    conversation. Most of the relationships that I have in design—with
    people that I talk with every day—I’ve never met before. But it was
    because one of us was interested in instigating a conversation by
    something as simple as an email.
  </p>
  <p>
    I would love to see people who are in different crafts and
    different mediums reach out and say “I want to build an experience.
    You do <i>this</i>. I do <i>this</i>.  How can we do <i>this</i>?
    How do we create something that’s bigger than the sum of
    our&nbsp;parts?”
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Someone should steal that idea.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    Yeah. Somebody should.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Would you be okay if someone stole that?</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    Somebody could totally take it! I don’t even need credit. Just
    tell me when you release your first experience and I will be there.
  </p>
  <h2>
    What advice would you give to upcoming generations of Orlando Creators?
  </h2>
  <p>
    I would say don’t wait for an invitation. That’s probably the
    biggest thing that I really believe. I didn’t go to school for
    design, and so when I came into this industry, I didn’t know where
    to go. I didn’t know how long was the ramp-up time before I can get
    involved or before I’m evaluated as a designer. I would say break
    down those barriers. Send an email to someone. Figure out how to
    get involved. I’d say we need more young people to just feel like
    they deserve a seat at the table. And they can just jump in with
    both feet and start going.
