<h2>How would you describe yourself?</h2>

<p>
  I would describe myself as a father and a husband first, obviously. But as
  far as creativity goes, I would describe myself as, really, a childlike
  artist.
</p>

<h2>
  In what ways as an artist do you feel that you’ve grown up and in what ways
  haven’t you?
</h2>

<p>
  I've definitely grown up in the sense that my motives for everything I do
  is so much different than when I first started out. I mean, I think we all go
  through this in some way, shape or form, where we want to be uber successful
  right? So like, we make that our goal.
</p>

<p>
  I've grown up in the aspect that my view of success is so beyond money,
  possessions, or fame, or whether people want to hear me talk, or whether
  people watch videos of me. My success is: did my art cause you to have an
  emotional response?
</p>

<p>
  But one of the areas that I struggle with as far as growing as a person, as
  an artist, is always worring about what my peers are thinking. What they're
  saying, what their view of me is. So it's like a, kind of like a struggle
  man. It's a big struggle.
</p>

<h2>Has being a father influenced your work?</h2>

<p>
  Big time. After having Harper and seeing how simple things can be for him to
  respond, it's kind of helped me not overdo my work at times. But also, I find
  myself even more driven to produce lasting art.
</p>

<p>
  So I try to not worry about what's the fad right now or what's the current
  trend. I’m playing the long game with my art. I want my son to be able to
  grow up knowing his dad’s an artist and I want him to appreciate my art for
  the years to come.
</p>

<h2>
  I love that. I love “playing the long game with your art.” Is that what you said?
</h2>

<p>Yeah.</p>

<h2>
  It's such a good way to look at it. People get so caught up in like what's going to get them the most likes now.
</h2>

<p>
  That's the pitfall of social media. We play that barometer game, right? We
  might produce something that we are extremely proud of and we'll put it out
  there for the masses. And we'll see that it didn't have as much likes as the
  other thing we created that happens to be the art trend right now. And
  learning to find the love and appreciation of your own art and knowing that's
  what's going to last.
</p>

<h2>Is anything you're excited about in Orlando?</h2>

<p>
  I'm excited for just all the opportunity that's now coming here. Jobs are
  opening here. Bigger companies are opening branches of their agencies here.
  It just feels like we're about to hit a really big art boom and I'm just
  excited to be part of that.
</p>

<h2>So you were born in Florida and then moved away. Why did you come back to Orlando?</h2>

<p>
  I just knew my time was done and I missed Orlando. I was like I need to get
  back there. I need to get back to where my family’s at, where my heart is at,
  where I feel inspired. I think family has definitely been a major factor for
  me to stay, especially now that I have a son. I can’t imagine taking him
  away.
</p>

<p>
  But there is still part of me that I just love this city. I feel like it
  deserves more credit than it’s given and I’m playing the long game with the
  city too.
</p>
