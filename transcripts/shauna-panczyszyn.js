<h2>How would you describe yourself?</h2>
<p>
  I’m a hand-lettering artist and illustrator and I specialize in very
  whimsical lettering and typography.
</p>
<h2>Would you still pursue hand-lettering even if there wasn’t a demand?</h2>
<p>
  I would. I got very lucky that I got into it as it was starting to gain
  traction and get more popular. But there’s always been a need for
  lettering. And there will always be a need for lettering.
</p>
<p>
  Right now we are at a peak where it is incredibly popular and everyone and
  their mother is doing it. I’m actually looking forward to the day that it’s
  not as popular!
</p>
<p>
  There are a lot of people who are jumping in [to lettering] who don’t know
  the true price. They lowball their efforts and unfortunately that hurts
  everyone else in the industry. They’re just kind of regurgitating what
  everyone else is doing already, so I’m looking forward to when it dies down
  again and there’s a little more originality to everything.
</p>
<h2>
  Do you think with increased demand some of the history and tradition is
  lost?
</h2>
<p>
  You know, it’s funny. Actually, a lot of people are going back to analog.
  For a while it was lost. Back when I was in college, everything was that
  very clean Swiss design and I was one of the few people in my class doing
  very gritty, rough stuff. Even when I graduated, everything was still very
  clean but slowly making that transition to a more rough, hand-rendered
  feel.
</p>
<p>
  Even in all the work I do now, even though I do it 100% digitally, it all
  looks like it could hav ebeen done on paper. I’ve made brushes for
  Photoshop that look like pencils and so to an extent there is like more of
  a harkening to the tradition and back to what people used to do. A lot more
  people are picking up sign painting now to learn that craft because it was
  lost for so many years beause of vinyl signs.
</p>
<h2>
  How have your design influences changed over the years?
</h2>
<p>
  A lot of what influences me is sort of what I see around me. I’m influenced
  a lot more by vintage typography and like sign painting, things like that.
</p>
<h2>
  How do you find that balance between pulling from inspiration and going into
  uncharted territory and doing your own thing?
</h2>
<p>
  A lot of it is I just have to let myself do and not think. In my offtime, I
  figure skate and it’s another instance where you can’t think wher you’re
  out there. Because the second you think, you’re catching a toe pick and
  going down.
</p>
<p>
  That same idea goes into my lettering practice. Just don’t think about it.
  Let it happen because the muscle memory is there, and it’s gonna happen
  naturally.
</p>
<h2>
  So you’ve been freelancing for about five years now. What’s motivated you
  to create your own job?
</h2>
<p>
  The fact that I get to make my own hours. After getting fired it was just
  something that I realized I don’t want to have to work for somebody else.
  I don’t like not having that control, so I hustle.
  I worked my butt off so that I can keep doing what I’m doing.
</p>
<h2>
  Do you have any advice for upcoming generations of Orlando Creators?
</h2>
<p>
  Be a good human and make friends, don’t network. If yo’re going to go in
  with the intention of meeting someone just to get a job or just to get a
  connection to someone else, you’re doing it wrong. Be a good person and do
  it because you love it. Don’t do it because you want to be the famous
  person.
