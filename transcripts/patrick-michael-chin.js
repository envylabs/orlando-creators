<h2>How would you describe yourself?</h2>
<p>
  My wife would describe me as a dreamer. In a good and bad sense. She’s
  more of a realist to it’s helpful for me. I constantly bounce from one idea
  to the next.
</p>
<h2>Being a self-described dreamer, is photography a glimpse into a better world?</h2>
<p>
  The goal is to make a space look better than it is, right? So when you’re
  capturing a space or when you’re trying to tell a story for a business,
  you want it to look like the most idealized version that you can. You
  start to think about if I take a if I take a photo, how can someone place
  themselves in this.

<h2>When did you first pick up a camera?</h2>
<p>
  I was in college. It was my freshman year. I had mentioned to a friend of
  mine that was a photographer that I was interested in photography but I
  didn’t know anything about it. He gifted me a camera in 2006. It’s an old
  ’60s Canon FX. It’s just an all metal,
  feel-like-you-can-throw-it-against-the-bricks-and-it’s-going-to-be-fine
  camera. Not everyone had a camera with them all the time so I was like the
  guy who always had a camera with me in college. I’d bring it on trips.
</p>
<p>
  Until the company I was working at in 2014, I still had never used a digital
  SLR. My company at the time bought me a camera and asked if I wanted to
  become their photographer in-house. I do feel like a lot of my story has
  been people seeing the things that I’m excited about and kind of championing
  them for me. So I feel like I owe a lot of other people credit for where
  I’ve gotten just because I don’t know that I would’ve tried.

<h2>
  Would you say there needs to be more people reaching out and encouraging
  others to pursue artistic passions?
</h2>
<p>
  I think one of the best things you can do when people are pursuing some
  sort of artistic anything is both give them loving criticism if they’re
  wanting that, but also encouraging what they’re trying to do and buying
  their art or, you know, telling them they’re on the right track. Anything
  you can do to help them along. They’re not going to get where they’re
  going without the people around them kind of pushing them and spurring
  them on.
</p>
<h2>Do you think we have that in Orlando?</h2>
<p>
  Man, I think, legitimately, Orlando’s in a really cool creative time. It’s
  a tight-knit community that’s trying to help each other. It feels like
  everyone in Orlando is aware that we’re in a cool point as far as there’s
  a lot of growth happening and there’s a lot of new ideas being tried here.
  You know, I can acknowledge that there’s a lot of other cities that are
  much further ahead than we are culturally or creatively but all that means
  is that there’s more opportunity here to attempt those things. It’s like
  the perfect time. If you have something you want to try, there’s a lot of
  people that want to see it work. So yeah, I love the community here right
  now.
