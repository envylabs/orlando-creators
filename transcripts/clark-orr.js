  <h2>Who is Clark Orr?</h2>
  <p>
    I am a graphic designer and illustrator here in Orlando, FL. I focus on
    branding, digital illustration, and packaging.
  </p>
  <h2>What motivates you to create?</h2>
  <p>
    It’s a funny question. I just have this kind of innate sense that I need to be
    creating, which sounds very big and maybe <em>spiritual</em>, but I’m happy when I
    create and I have this thing inside me that says that I have to keep making
    something.
  </p>
  <h2>
    In the wake of Pulse, you got to respond by making artwork. What was that
    like?
  </h2>
  <p>
    Yeah, that was obviously a heavy day for Orlando specifically and the gay
    community specifically. I tried to figure out a way that I could give back.
    Like how I could be most effective and I didn’t think it was through giving
    blood or necessarily donating water. I wanted to figure a bigger impact and how
    I could spend my time quickly. So I <a
    href="https://store.mamas-sauce.com/products/the-city-beautiful"
    target="_blank">designed a print</a>—an Orlando print—the morning after I found
    out and hit up <a href="http://mamas-sauce.com" target="_blank">Mama’s Sauce
    here in Orlando and they donated the printing cost and our friends <a
    href="https://www.frenchpaper.com" target="_blank">French Paper</a> in Michigan
    donated the paper and we just went to work. We put it up online and I think we
    raised over $10,000 for the victims of Pulse and their families and that
    would’ve been a make better use of our time than spending $50 or $100 on water
    or standing in line when they were turning people away. I felt very, very lucky
    to contribute and help out when our town was most in need.

  <h2>What’s it like being married to a fellow creative?</h2>
  <p>
    It’s awesome! We have a company together called <a
    href="https://www.hellcatsinc.com" target="_blank">Hellcats Inc</a>. My wife,
    Brittany, has her own company called <a href="https://goodcompanyco.etsy.com"
    target="_blank">Good Company Co</a>. She makes her own clothes and wall
    hangings. She’s great at what she does and we wanted to figure out a way to
    collaborate together that was outside of what she does and outside what I do.
    We started about 7 months ago and it’s been awesome.
  </p>
  <h2>Why are you in Orlando?</h2>
  <p>
    Orlando is awesome. I love it because there’s something in the water here.
    So many designers and creatives are actually from here. I’m a strong
    proponent of staying here and making this place even cooler than it already is,
    which is honestly pretty cool.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Orlando needs more people like that.</strong></p>
  <p>
    Yeah! What’s crazy is we have a lot of them and right now we’re starting to
    learn that and a lot of people are realizing if you want to see something and
    be a part of something you kind of have to do it on your own. There’s a gold
    rush here now and it’s inspiring and I like being a part it.
  </p>
  <h2>What do you find exciting about some of the work being done in Orlando?</h2>
  <p>
    It’s really on par with stuff that’s going on in New York and LA and San
    Francisco and Chicago and London and Paris, honestly. A lot of people are doing
    stuff out here even better than some of those places. And it’s also affordable
    to do your dream here. You can’t start a business here and then move it out to
    San Francisco. There’s no way you can do that. So I think that’s part of why
    you’re seeing a large movement of people who are from here and even some people
    who are moving here to kind of start their dream. It’s really cool.
