# Orlando Creators

## Setup

This is a [next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/) app.

```
yarn
```

## Dev

```
npm run dev
```

This repo uses the [ESLint](http://eslint.org/) Airbnb style for JS
linting. Configuring your editor to prefer local ESLint over global
will reflect the style of this repo.

## Deploy

Add the Heroku app `orlando-creators` as a remote on the project,
and push `master` to that remote when youâ€™re ready to deploy. Node
scripts handle the rest.
